# Kotlin Fundamentals

## Introduction
- This is my repo for learning Makers Module 3 - Kotlin Fundamentals.
- This project is just practise code for learning Kotlin syntax.
- `Main.kt` contains commented practise code, consisting of practise and exercises for each learning objective.

## Objectives
I used this project to learn how to:
- [x] Explain and use data types in Kotlin.
- [x] Write Kotlin functions.
- [x] Use conditionals in Kotlin.
- [x] Use collections such as lists and maps in Kotlin.
- [x] Use higher-order functions and lambdas.
- [x] Write classes in Kotlin.
- [x] Write unit tests in Kotlin.
- [x] Install libraries using the tool Gradle.


## Setup
To run the program in IntelliJ, navigate to `Main.kt` and then:
- `Ctrl + R`
- Or press "play"

To run the tests in IntelliJ:
- Run a single test (using the "play" button next to where it is declared in the editor).
- Run all tests in a test class (using the "play" button next to the class declaration in the editor).
- Run all tests in the project (In the file explorer, right-click on the tests directory then select "Run tests in hello.test")
